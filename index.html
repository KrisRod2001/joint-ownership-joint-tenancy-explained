  <h1>What Is Joint Ownership / Joint Tenancy?</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <p>
    Joint ownership, commonly known as joint tenancy, is a form of property ownership where two or more people own a property together. Each owner holds an equal share of the property, and all owners have the same legal rights to use and enjoy it.
  </p>

  <h2>How Joint Tenancy Works</h2>
  <p>
    Under joint tenancy, the owners are treated as a single unit in terms of ownership. One key feature is the right of survivorship, meaning that if one owner passes away, their share automatically transfers to the remaining owner or owners.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Characteristics of Joint Ownership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Equal ownership shares among all parties</li>
    <li>Right of survivorship applies</li>
    <li>All owners acquire the property at the same time</li>
    <li>Decisions usually require agreement from all owners</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Joint Tenancy vs Other Ownership Types</h2>
  <p>
    Joint tenancy differs from other forms of ownership, such as tenants in common, where each owner may hold a different share and can pass their portion to beneficiaries through a will rather than automatically to the other owners.
  </p>

  <h2>When Joint Ownership Is Commonly Used</h2>
  <p>
    This type of ownership is often chosen by spouses, partners, or family members who want simplicity in ownership transfer and equal control over the property.
